## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive web design
- Vanilla js

### What I learned
Every new JavaScript project is a challenge for me, and in this particular project, I learned how to generate a password based on user input and display it on a web page. By interacting with checkboxes, the user can select which types of characters they want in their password. The code then builds a string of valid characters based on these selections and uses it to generate a random password of a specified length, as determined by a slider input. This project taught me how to create passwords of varying strengths for users to copy and use.
